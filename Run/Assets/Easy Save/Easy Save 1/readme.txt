Thank-you for purchasing Easy Save, and supporting the Unity scene.



##### Important Note to Javascript Users #####

If you want to call EasySave functions from a Javascript script, you must put the Easy Save 
folder in the 'Standard Assets' folder. If the Standard Assets folder does not already exist,
create a new folder in the root directory and name it 'Standard Assets'.


##### Important Note to Android Users ##### 

Your application needs the correct permissions
set to be able to save to device. 
To set this, go to: Edit -> Project Settings -> 
Player -> Android Tab -> Other Settings -> Configuration -> Force SD Card permission.
