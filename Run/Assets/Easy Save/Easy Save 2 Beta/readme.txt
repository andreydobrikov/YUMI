Thank-you for purchasing Easy Save, and supporting the Unity scene.



##### Important Note to Javascript Users #####

If you want to call EasySave functions from a Javascript script, you must put the Easy Save 
folder in the 'Standard Assets' folder. If the Standard Assets folder does not already exist,
create a new folder in the root directory and name it 'Standard Assets'.


##### Important Note to Android Users ##### 

Your application needs the correct permissions
set to be able to save to device. 
To set this, go to: Edit -> Project Settings -> 
Player -> Android Tab -> Other Settings -> Configuration -> Force SD Card permission.

##### Important Note to those using Encryption #####

If using encryption it may be necessary to declare that you are using encryption in certain countries.
For example, you will be asked if you are using encryption when submitting an app to the Apple App Store.
